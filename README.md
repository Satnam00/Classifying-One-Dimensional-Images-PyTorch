# Image Classification using Logistic Regression inÂ PyTorch

In this tutorial, we'll use our existing knowledge of PyTorch and linear regression to solve a very different kind of problem: image classification. We'll use the famous MNIST Handwritten Digits Database as our training dataset. It consists of 28px by 28px grayscale images of handwritten digits (0 to 9), along with labels for each image indicating which digit it represents. Here are some sample images from the dataset:

## Exploring the Data
We begin by importing torch and torchvision. torchvision contains some utilities for working with image data. It also contains helper classes to automatically download and import popular datasets like MNIST.

## Training and Validation Datasets
While building real world machine learning models, it is quite common to split the dataset into 3 parts:

Training set - used to train the model i.e. compute the loss and adjust the weights of the model using gradient descent.
Validation set - used to evaluate the model while training, adjust hyperparameters (learning rate etc.) and pick the best version of the model.
Test set - used to compare different models, or different types of modeling approaches, and report the final accuracy of the model.
In the MNIST dataset, there are 60,000 training images, and 10,000 test images. The test set is standardized so that different researchers can report the results of their models against the same set of images.

Since there's no predefined validation set, we must manually split the 60,000 images into training and validation datasets. Let's set aside 10,000 randomly chosen images for validation. We can do this using the random_spilt method from PyTorch.

## Model
Now that we have prepared our data loaders, we can define our model.

A logistic regression model is almost identical to a linear regression model i.e. there are weights and bias matrices, and the output is obtained using simple matrix operations (pred = x @ w.t() + b).

Just as we did with linear regression, we can use nn.Linear to create the model instead of defining and initializing the matrices manually.

Since nn.Linear expects the each training example to be a vector, each 1x28x28 image tensor needs to be flattened out into a vector of size 784 (28*28), before being passed into the model.

The output for each image is vector of size 10, with each element of the vector signifying the probability a particular target label (i.e. 0 to 9). The predicted label for an image is simply the one with the highest probability.

## Cross Entropy
While the accuracy is a great way for us (humans) to evaluate the model, it can't be used as a loss function for optimizing our model using gradient descent, for the following reasons:

It's not a differentiable function. torch.max and == are both non-continuous and non-differentiable operations, so we can't use the accuracy for computing gradients w.r.t the weights and biases.

It doesn't take into account the actual probabilities predicted by the model, so it can't provide sufficient feedback for incremental improvements.

Due to these reasons, accuracy is a great evaluation metric for classification, but not a good loss function. A commonly used loss function for classification problems is the cross entropy, which has the following formula:

cross-entropy

While it looks complicated, it's actually quite simple:

For each output row, pick the predicted probability for the correct label. E.g. if the predicted probabilities for an image are [0.1, 0.3, 0.2, ...] and the correct label is 1, we pick the corresponding element 0.3 and ignore the rest.

Then, take the logarithm of the picked probability. If the probability is high i.e. close to 1, then its logarithm is a very small negative value, close to 0. And if the probability is low (close to 0), then the logarithm is a very large negative value. We also multiply the result by -1, which results is a large postive value of the loss for poor predictions.

Finally, take the average of the cross entropy across all the output rows to get the overall loss for a batch of data.

Unlike accuracy, cross-entropy is a continuous and differentiable function that also provides good feedback for incremental improvements in the model (a slightly higher probability for the correct label leads to a lower loss). This makes it a good choice for the loss function.

As you might expect, PyTorch provides an efficient and tensor-friendly implementation of cross entropy as part of the torch.nn.functional package. Moreover, it also performs softmax internally, so we can directly pass in the outputs of the model without converting them into probabilities.

Since the cross entropy is the negative logarithm of the predicted probability of the correct label averaged over all training samples, one way to interpret the resulting number e.g. 2.23 is look at e^-2.23 which is around 0.1 as the predicted probability of the correct label, on average. Lower the loss, better the model.

## Training the model
Now that we have defined the data loaders, model, loss function and optimizer, we are ready to train the model. The training process is identical to linear regression, with the addition of a "validation phase" to evaluate the model in each epoch. Here's what it looks like in pseudocode:

for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    # Training phase
    for batch in train_loader:
        # Generate predictions
        # Calculate loss
        # Compute gradients
        # Update weights
        # Reset gradients
    
    # Validation phase
    for batch in val_loader:
        # Generate predictions
        # Calculate loss
        # Calculate metrics (accuracy etc.)
    # Calculate average validation loss & metrics
    
    # Log epoch, loss & metrics for inspection
    
## Fit Function
The fit function records the validation loss and metric from each epoch and returns a history of the training process. This is useful for debuggin & visualizing the training process. Before we train the model, let's see how the model performs on the validation set with the initial set of randomly initialized weights & biases.

Configurations like batch size, learning rate etc. need to picked in advance while training machine learning models, and are called hyperparameters. Picking the right hyperparameters is critical for training an accurate model within a reasonable amount of time, and is an active area of research and experimentation. Feel free to try different learning rates and see how it affects the training process.

## Drawbacks
The more likely reason that the model just isn't powerful enough. If you remember our initial hypothesis, we have assumed that the output (in this case the class probabilities) is a linear function of the input (pixel intensities), obtained by perfoming a matrix multiplication with the weights matrix and adding the bias. This is a fairly weak assumption, as there may not actually exist a linear relationship between the pixel intensities in an image and the digit it represents. While it works reasonably well for a simple dataset like MNIST (getting us to 85% accuracy), we need more sophisticated models that can capture non-linear relationships between image pixels and labels for complex tasks like recognizing everyday objects, animals etc
